## :warning: Read Me First!
**Full Disclosure** This project was created post-competition as an academic exercise only, purely to demonstrate an alternate approach to the challenge. None of this content was disclosed until after competition and judging.

## Design Process and Justifications
### Agile vs Waterfall
We've chosen an agile methodology as an iterative approach, focus on the following goals:

#### Return on Investment
By delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) to our customer as soon possible will allow them to build a hub and start reaping the benefits well ahead of the competitors.

> During simulation, if there's a positive ROI ( :moneybag: :chart_with_upwards_trend: = :thumbsup: ), we will ship it.

#### Iteration and Continuous improvement
We'll take customer feedback and work on creating a better algorithm and user experience.

> If it **works**, who cares if it looks good, I'll buy it.  *<sub>- Ol' Musky Accounting Dept.</sub>*
> If it **looks** good, who cares if it works, I'll buy it.  *<sub>- Ol' Musky Marketing Dept.</sub>*
> If it looks good **and** works, I'll keep using it .  *<sub>- Ol' Musky Customer</sub>*

The requirements indicate that the goal is to make more money, therefore a better algorithm takes precedence over user experience.

> During simulation, if there ROI is better than the previous MVP, we will ship it.


#### The K.I.S.S.T.W.D.W.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.T.W.E Principle
Keep It Simple So That We Don't Waste Tremendous Time Totally Trying To Tackle The Whole Enchilada

### Scrum Tools and Plan
- Source Control: Github
- Scrum Board: Zenhub 

**Sprint 0** is an initial investment of time before actually starting
- Understand the requirements
- Create enough user stories to get started
- Decide on a programming language
- Setup tools and environment
- Validate API

**Sprint Length: 1 hour** The team has decided a length of 60 Minutes, this will allow 
for:
- 5-10 minutes discussing and understanding the story
- 45 minutes of development and testing
- 5 minutes of demo

We believe that after Sprint 0, we should have enough time for around 6 sprints before the competition ends.
